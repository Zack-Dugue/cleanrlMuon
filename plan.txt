Here's the plan:

We want to evaluate Muon for RL. We'll be comparing
*SGD
*Adam
*Muon
*AdaMuon

We're gonna compare across the whole Atari Suite. Doing HPO on a subset of games, and then evaluating on the rest.
Since larger models are where

For algorithms we'll evaluate using:
* PPO
* SAC
* DQN

For PPO we'll tune:
    * LR
    *
